# battleship_game

Python project using turtle graphics.

This is the classic game, Battleship. First you set up your ships, then the computer sets up its ships at random. The two players take turns trying to 'strike' a boat. White is a miss. Red is a hit. You type your guesses into the shell, for example, 'B10' or 'c8'.

This is an early project I programmed, just for fun, to practice completing a complete game design. I had to create an algorithm for the computer to sink a boat once hit. The computer chooses a 'strike' at random until a boat is hit. Then it systematically sinks the boat. Surprisingly, the computer player wins quite often. The turtle graphics are very simple (and slow), but I like this program because it shows some of my early work before I knew anything about design patterns and writing efficient code!
